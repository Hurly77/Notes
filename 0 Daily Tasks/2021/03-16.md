Note: Group project needs to decide on a couple of things

1. We need to Know exact Routes that we’ll need to make it complete
   - login, signup(could be on same page like with a modal)
   - any nested Routes for user profile etc.
2. We Need @ least 2 Main Features
   - The first will be for Users with and account
   - will be for both Users with or without an account
3. User Data needs to be simplified down to (MVP).
   - Login / Sign-up info (name, username, password)
   - also any other data we’d need for signup user feature.
4. Last but not least Stack will remain as MERN using Next as frame work for (SSR)
   - (SSR) Is Server Side Rendering and is a key feature to using Next.js
   - Also will be using testing library, jest and we’ll be doing test First development.
   - test first means exactly what is sounds like. write test be for the code that it will be checking.
   - implementation as it stands will only be unit, functional and very minimal Behavioral testing.
