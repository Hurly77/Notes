### Ignorance is bliss 

Bad example of Delete and Patch

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
 
delete '/people/:id', to: 'people#destroy', as:'person'

```

```erb
# app/views/people/show.html.erb
 
<h2><%= @person.name %></h2>
<%= @person.email %>
<%= form_tag person_path(@person.id), method: "delete" do %>
  <%= submit_tag "Delete #{@person.name}" %>
<% end %>
```

Let's get started with the right way to do things.

```ruby
#app/controllers/people_controller.rb

def destroy
Person.find(params[:id]).destroy
redirect_to people_url
end
```

```erb
<!-- app/views/people/index.html.erb //-->
 
<% @people.each do |person| %>
<div class="person">
  <span><%= person.name %></span>
  <%= link_to "Delete", person, method: :delete, data: { confirm: "Really?" } %>
</div>
<% end %>
```

[`link_to`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#method-i-link_to) is a method of `UrlHelper` that has a number of convenient features.

The HTML generated by that call to `link_to` looks like this:

```html
<a data-confirm="Really?" rel="nofollow" data-method="delete" href="/people/1">Delete</a>
```

The `data-confirm` attribute and the `data-method` attribute rely on some JavaScript built into Rails.

`data-method` will "submit" a `DELETE` request as if a form had been submitted. It will use `GET` (the default method used by all browsers for HTML links) if the user has JavaScript disabled.

`data-confirm` pops up a confirmation window before the link is followed, allowing the user to make sure they're ready to delete someone forever (what a decision!).

### Use `button_to`

A slight variation from the `link_to` method described above is using `button_to` to send a delete request.

[`button_to`] Generates a form containing a single button that submits to the URL created by the set of options.

So while we taught `link_to` first, Rails thinks that `button_to` is a safer tool for representing delete requests. Interesting! The `button_to` helper works very similarly to `link_to`:

```erb
<%= button_to "Delete Image", image_path(@image), method: :delete %>
```
