## What is a Dynamic ORM?

**A dynamic ORM** allows us to **map** an existing **database** table to a class **and** write methods that **can use nothing more than** information regarding a specific database **table to**:

- Create `attr_accessors` for a Ruby class.
- Create shareable methods for inserting, updating, selecting, and deleting data from the database table.

This pattern –– first creating the database table and having your program do all the work of writing your ORM methods for you, based on that table –– is exactly how we will develop web applications in Sinatra and Rails.

## Creating Our ORM

## Step 1: Setting Up the Database

To create a dynamic ORM, we start by creating our database and songs table. In `config/environment.rb` you'll find the following code:

```ruby
# WE ARE IN THE config/enviroment.rb
require 'sqlite3'
 
 
DB = {:conn => SQLite3::Database.new("db/songs.db")}#create table
DB[:conn].execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS songs")#DROP TABLE, incase it already exitst
 
sql = <<-SQL 
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS songs (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  album TEXT
  )
SQL

DB[:conn].execute(sql)
DB[:conn].results_as_hash = true # this is say to return as array not hash that would look like this
{"id"=>1, "name"=>"Hello", "album"=>"25", 0 => 1, 1 => "Hello", 2 => "25"}
```

## Step 2: Building ' attr_accessors ' from column names

The **goal** of our **dynamic ORM** is to define a series of methods that can be shared by *any **class***

### The #table_name Method

```ruby

class Song
  def self.table_name
    self.to_s.downcase.pluralize #this turns the self into string than down cases all chars and pluralizes it. THE "pluralize" method is required byactive_support/inflector code library
  end
end
```

### The #column_names Method

**Querying a table for column names:**

How do you query a table for the names of its columns

```ruby
PRAGMA table_info(<table name>)
```

This line of code that utilizes [PRAGMA](https://learn.co/tracks/online-software-engineering-structured/orms-and-activerecord/orms/dynamic-orms#resources) will **return** to us (thanks to our handy `#results_as_hash` method) an **array** of **hashes** describing the **table** itself. look something like this:

This **pragma** returns one **row** for each **column** in the named table. 

```ruby
 [{"cid"=>0,
  "name"=>"id",
  "type"=>"INTEGER",
  "notnull"=>0,
  "dflt_value"=>nil,
  "pk"=>1,
  0=>0,
  1=>"id",
  2=>"INTEGER",
  3=>0,
  4=>nil,
  5=>1},
 {"cid"=>1,
  "name"=>"name",
  "type"=>"TEXT",
  "notnull"=>0,
  "dflt_value"=>nil,
  "pk"=>0,
  0=>1,
  1=>"name",
  2=>"TEXT",
  3=>0,
  4=>nil,
  5=>0},
 {"cid"=>2,
  "name"=>"album",
  "type"=>"TEXT",
  "notnull"=>0,
  "dflt_value"=>nil,
  "pk"=>0,
  0=>2,
  1=>"album",
  2=>"TEXT",
  3=>0,
  4=>nil,
  5=>0}]
```



### Building our method:** 

```ruby
def self.column_names
  DB[:conn].results_as_hash = true
 
  sql = "PRAGMA table_info('#{table_name}')" #each column into a row
 
  table_info = DB[:conn].execute(sql) #returns a arr of hashes
  column_names = [] #and empty array
 
  table_info.each do |column|
    column_names << column["name"]#then grabs the name of each column
  end
 
  column_names.compact#this gets rid of any nil values that may end up in the collection
end
#then returned to us is
=> ["id", "name", "album"]
```

## Metaprogramming our  | attr_accessors |

We can **assign** every **attribute** to **colum** like :

```ruby
class Song
  def self.table_name
    #table_name code
  end
 
  def self.column_names
    #column_names code
  end
 
  self.column_names.each do |col_name| #iterate over all column names
    attr_accessor col_name.to_sym #uses the "attr_accessor" to call col_name and set each value to a symbol which in turn makes it an attribute
  end
end
```

This is **metaprogramming** because we are **writing** **code** that **writes** **code** for us.

Now we can build the **initialize** method. we'll also make out intialize method into a **dynamic** **OMR**

### The #0initialize Method

```ruby
def initialize(options={})#THIS initializes argument "options" to default to AN EMPTY HASH
  options.each do |property, value| #THEN we iterate over options 
    self.send("#{property}=", value)#setting key as a method that points to a value that method belongs to.
  end
end
```

As long as each `property` has a corresponding `attr_accessor`, this `#initialize` method will work.

## Step 4: Writing our ORM Methods

## #save

### Saving Records in a Dynamic Manner

#### to use a class method inside an instance method, we need to do the following:

```ruby
def some_instance_method
  self.class.some_class_method
end

def table_name_for_insert #We can wrap up this code in a handy method
  self.class.table_name
end
#Great, now let's grab our column names in an abstract manner.
```

#### Abstracting the Column Names

```ruby
#We already have a handy method for grabbing the column names of the table associated with a given class:
self.class.column_names # which will return:
["id", "name", "album"]
```

This however **won't work** because **SQL database** handles the **creation** of the **ID**. So, when we **save** our Ruby object, we should **not** include the **id** column name **or** insert a **value**

```ruby
#this will delete what ever returns true
self.class.column_names.delete_if {|col| col == "id"} 
#this will return us:
["name", "album"]
#we can use the same technique to turn the above into a string instead of and arr
self.class.column_names.delete_if {|col| col == "id"}.join(", ")
#this will return:
"name, album"
```

Perfect! Now we have all the code we need to grab a **comma** separated **list**

```ruby
def col_names_for_insert
  self.class.column_names.delete_if {|col| col == "id"}.join(", ")
end
```

Lastly, we need an **abstract** way to grab the ***values*** we want to **insert**.

```ruby
values = [] #create and empty array
 
self.class.column_names.each do |col_name| #iterate over the colum names
  values << "'#{send(col_name)}'" unless send(col_name).nil? # then we shovel the the method value into our array unless the value is nil.
end
```

Notice that we are wrapping the **return value** in a **string.** That is **because** we are trying to **craft a string of SQL**. Also notice that **each individual value** will be enclosed in single **quotes, `' '`**, inside that string. That is **because** the final **SQL** string will need to look like this:

```ruby
INSERT INTO songs (name, album)
VALUES 'Hello', '25';
#from this we get 
["'the name of the song'", "'the album of the song'"] #but we want a string not an array
```

```ruby
def values_for_insert
  values = []
  self.class.column_names.each do |col_name|
    values << "'#{send(col_name)}'" unless send(col_name).nil?
  end
  values.join(", ") #this will turn our array into a string-list
end
```

#### The `#save` Method:

```ruby
def save
  DB[:conn].execute("INSERT INTO #{table_name_for_insert} (#{col_names_for_insert}) VALUES (?)", [values_for_insert])
 
  @id = DB[:conn].execute("SELECT last_insert_rowid() FROM #{table_name_for_insert}")[0][0]
end
```

**Note**: Using `String` interpolation for a SQL query creates a SQL injection vulnerability, which we've previously stated is a bad idea as it creates a security issue, however, we're using these examples to illustrate how dynamic ORMs work.

### Selecting Records in a Dynamic Manner

**FIND_BY_NAME**

```ruby
def self.find_by_name(name)
  DB[:conn].execute("SELECT * FROM #{self.table_name} WHERE name = ?", [name])
end
#Note: Using String interpolation for a SQL query creates a SQL injection
```
