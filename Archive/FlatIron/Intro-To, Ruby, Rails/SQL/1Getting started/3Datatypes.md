## Datatypes

 four basic categories of datatypes; they are:

### TEXT

Any alphanumeric characters which we want to represent as plain text

### INTEGER

Anything we want to represent as a whole number. If it's a number and contains no letter or special characters or decimal points

### REAL

Anything that's a plain old decimal like 1.3 or 2.25. SQLite will store decimals up to 15 characters long

### BLOB

It is generally used for holding binary data
