## `WINDOW`

The `window` is a variable that points to an object that represents Chrome's info about the browser. The `Window` is where things are defined(`array`, `string` and `number`)

In the `window`, java script also tracks operating system browser information like:

```javascript
window.innerHeight;
// returns the inner height of the browser window.
```

Like any other object `window` has methods.

We want, rather, to change content. We're going to focus on an object called `document`.

## `document`

As an object, `document` has properties 

```javascript
document.URL //=> http://www.flatironschool.com
```

As an *object* `document` also has *methods*:

```javascript
document.write("Moof") //=> Removes all existing DOM content, replaces it with "Moof"
```

The ***methods*** and ***properties*** that the DOM provides via its objects is called the DOM's "**Application Programming Interface**," or "**API**." It's just a programming word that you're likely to see online. But it just means "the things that these objects know how to do."
