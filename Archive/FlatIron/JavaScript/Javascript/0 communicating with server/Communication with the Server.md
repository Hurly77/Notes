1. What are the three Pillars of Web Programming

   > Manipulation the DOM
   >
   > Creating events
   >
   > Communication with the server

2. Describe the process of communicating with the server

   > When an **event** such as a like Icon being **clicked** to updates the user's DOM. This will **set off** a sequence of **actions** to **notify** the **server**, so that the original poster can be notified that you favorited it. **JavaScript** needs to **send** a **message** to the **server** when the **click** event runs, and the **server** needs to **indicate** **success** so that the **DOM** can **update** accordingly.

3. Define AJAX

   > **AJAX** is short for (**(A)**synchronous **(J)**avaScript (**A**)nd **(X)**ML) it's the general **way** we make **requests** to the server **without** **reloading** the web page. We **first** give the user **HTML** and **CSS** 
   >
   > and **then** JavaScript behind the scenes. **JavaScript** then **fills** in the rest of the **actions**. **one** of the most efficient **ways** is with: **fetch()** 
   >
   > Data that comes back from the server is not sent in HTML. It **use to** be **sent** back in **XML**, **it's now** most-often sent back in a format known as **JSON** ("Jay-Sawn"). **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation (JSON) is a `String` that JavaScript knows how to **turn** into an `Object`
