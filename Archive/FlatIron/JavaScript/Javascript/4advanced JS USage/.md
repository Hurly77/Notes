real-world questions:

- "If these projected profits turned to losses, what would those losses be?"
- "What numbers in this data set are larger than 200? Larger than 2,000? Larger than an argument a user might provide?"
- "Which painting is the most valuable?"
- "Which painting is the least valuable?"
- "Do any of these children have a wet cough?"

These real-world questions involve:

1. Finding a collection of data, typically stored in an `Array` or `Object`
2. Visiting each element (`Array`) or pair (`Object`) in the collection
3. Doing some "work" with that element or pair
4. Returning a new collection **or** a new value based on the "work" that touched each element

"Collection-Processing Method" is what we call a method provided by JavaScript that:

1. "visits" each element or pair in a collection
2. tests those elements or pairs with "work"
3. returns a new collection **or** a value

Methods that behave in this way we'll say have the "Character of Collection Processing."

## Pseudocode a Real-World Use of "Collection-Processing Methods"

`iHearASickSound`'s pseudocode looks like this:

```js
def iHearASickSound(passengerNoises)
  # Given a collection of passengers' sounds ["coughing", "yawning", "sneezing", "singing Jamaican traditional folksong"]
  # If any of them are sick sounds: cough, yawn
  # return `true`; else, return `false`
end
```

If we were to encode this, we might write the (real code, not pseudocode) the method as:

```js
function iHearASickSound(passengersSounds) {
  for (let i = 0; i < passengersSounds.length; i++) {
    if (passengersSounds[i] === "coughing" ||
        passengersSounds[i] === "sneezing" ) {
      return true
    }
  }
  return false;
}
 
iHearASickSound(["coughing", "foo", "bar", "bin", "bat"]) //=> true
iHearASickSound(["sneezing", "foo", "bar", "bin", "bat"]) //=> true
iHearASickSound([            "foo", "bar", "bin", "bat"]) //=> false
```

challenging coding ideas of:

- Capturing work (but not *doing* it) using (anonymous) functions
- Doing the work and passing it arguments based on visiting each element or pair in the collection. This is called invoking the method. As a surprising monkey-wrench that causes tons of bugs, we'll need to reckon with JavaScript's "execution context" when we do the work (more on that later!)
- Gathering a new collection **or** combining the individual results into an aggregate result
