### Making a User story

- Who is your User?
- What is their pain point?
- How do they use our solution to overcome this problem?

> **Example**: Sally is trying to get into hiking and wants to keep track of her favorite trails. Sally wants a place to write notes about each trail and her experiences:
>
> - Sally is able to enter trail information and notes through a form
> - She can navigate to an index page to see all her previous hikes
> - Sally can see more detailed information about a specific hike by clicking on it
