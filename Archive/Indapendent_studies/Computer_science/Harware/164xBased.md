**ASCII** abreviated from - **American Standard Code for Information Interchange**,

ASCII codes represent text in computers, [telecommunications equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_equipment), and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters

It is a code for representing 128 English characters as numbers, with each letter assigned a number from 0 to 127. For example, the **ASCII** code for uppercase M is 77. ... Most data files, particularly if they contain numeric data, are not stored in **ASCII format**. Executable programs are never stored in **ASCII format**.

**Base64** encoding is a process of converting binary data to an ASCII string format by converting that [binary data](https://www.lifewire.com/binary-data-types-in-sql-server-1019807) into a 6-bit character representation. The Base64 method of encoding is used when binary data, such as images or video, is transmitted over systems that are designed to transmit data in a plain-text (ASCII) format.
