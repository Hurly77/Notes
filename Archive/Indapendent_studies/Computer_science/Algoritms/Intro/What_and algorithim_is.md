#### What are algorithms in CS

**Algorthims**-  One definition might be a set of steps to accomplish a task.

**How Th efficiency of an algorithm is measured** This is accomplished through a techmique called **asympotic analysis**

**asympotic analysis** allows algorithims to be compared independently of a particular programming language or hardware
