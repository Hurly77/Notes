##### How do you store or represint infomation using electricity?

**Binary task for ask two this** 

| ON   | Off   |
| ---- | ----- |
| True | False |
| Yes  | No    |
| 1    | 0     |

Or anything that has only to objective options

**Bit** - The On/Off stat of a single wire is called a bit Which is the smallest piece of information a computer can store

More Wore means More bits

#### Binary System

**Decimal** - Are any digits from 0  to 9 **but, Binary is only two digits**

Decimal Number System			

|       | 9    | 0    | 0    |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1000s | 100s | 10s  | 1s   |

Binary Number System

|      | 9    | 0    | 0    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 8s   | 4s   | 2s   | 1s   |

| 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    | 1    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 128s | 64s  | 32s  | 16s  | 8s   | 4s   | 2s   | 1s   |

`9` in the binary system is `1001` This is calulated like so`(1x8)+(0x4)+(0x2)+(1x1)`

any number can be represented as: 

**1 / 0 or, WIRE ON / WIRE OFF.**

8 wires can represent 0..255 32 wires can represent 0... 4billion

Because we include 0 as numer each wire can only represent the value(s) place times to - 1 like so `128x2 = 256-1 = 255` 

##### Pixels

>  -  the **pixel** (a word invented from "picture element") is the **basic** unit of programmable color on a computer display or in a computer image.

Each pixil has a 3 colors **r**ed,**g**reen **b**lue wich is represented like (2)(255..0, wich is also 8 wires of data) (253, 78, 141)  a general image is has millions of pixels and video show 30 images persecond

##### Waveform

Sound is just vibrations in the air, wich can be represented as a graph and each point of the wave can be represented as a number on the graph.

8-bit vs 32-bit is the amount of wires used to calulate that data.

this means higher level of clearity 

Binary is the back bone of computers
