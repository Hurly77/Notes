There an experment done called the **a**dvanced **r**easearch **p**roject **a**genct or **ARPANET** 

They were trying build a communiction deviece that could survive an nuclear attack so they launched a nation wide **packet network**

NOBODY AND EVERBODY controls the internet.

They are all indapendent comunication devieces.

1 and 0 is a bit or one transitor or wire. 8 bits = 1 byte 1024 bytes = 1kilobyte 1000killobytes = 1mega byte 1000mgbs = 1gbs 1000gbs = 1 terobyte

bits are sent via 

- **LIght** - We do this via fiber optics, 
  - **fiber optics** is a thread of glass used to reflect light.
  - This also means no deteration of signal.
  - **But** it is also really expensive and Hard to work with
- **radio waves** -  The Binary code is converted into a wave then recieved an turned back into binary.
  - though radion wave can't travel very far.
- **electricity** - through circuts, and signals.
  - **Ethernet** cables are the main source of transmiting data.

**Bandwidth** -Maximum transmission capacity of a device.

**Bit Rate** - Number of bits that we can send over a given period of time.  measured in seconds usually

**Latency** Time it takes for a bit to travel from on place to another, point **a** to point **b**
