Every **input or output** of a computer is **effectively a type of information** which can be represented by on of off **electriacl signals** or one's and Zero's. In order **to process the information that comes in**, as input, and the make the information thats's output **A computer needs to modify and combine the input signals**. To do this, a computer uses millions of tiny electronic. componets, which come together to form circuits.

A simple Circuit takes an electric singnal and flips it.

TYPES OF CIRCUITS

**NOT** - They call it **not**, 

**AND** - IF you hav to wires that go into another if either are off its off but if both are on then so is it this is and &&

**ADDER** Circuite takes in combindes all the wires and add them together to calculate the sum. t

8 BIT ADDER - Takes in a bunck of littlle ADDERS to calculate the sum.

Electricity - Travels almost at the speed of light, wich means. Todays circuits are close to microscopical Which is why todays devices are so fast because the can do millions of calculations in a matter seconds.
