When creating a `.ts` file that contains JSX Babel/Typescript will show an unhelpful error that does not mention you have to rename `.ts` to `.tsx` for JSX parsing to work.

## Describe the solution you'd like

I'm quite certain this error in particular happens in multiple cases  and not just in the case of using JSX, however we could extend the error message to include potential ways to solve it.

# Notes

- Status code `500` - internal sever error
