# Data Type and Structures

There are three main kinds of data Types Numbers, Strings and Booleans. Then we have nullified values such as Null, NaN and undefined.

#### Numbers (0-9)

A number is any character notated as 0-9 and is not wrapped in quotes if a number is wrapped in quotes it is considered a string.

#### Strings ( "strings have double / single quotes" )

A string is considered any thing that is wrapped in either single or double quotes in JavaScript it does not matter which you use.



#### booleans( True / False )

A boolean is notetated as being called true or false or any thing that returns a true or false value. 

```javascript
//useing operators will always return a true or false value 
//to compare to values we can use Operators, more on that later

let teacher = "cameron"
let student = "Daegan"
let cameron = teacher
// if statements ask questions 

if (teacher === student){
    return "They are the same"
} else {
    return "They are not the same"
}
```



#### Null, NaN and undefined

anything that returns a value that does not exits is either null, NaN or undefined.

```javascript
// if I declare a variable with out a value it is undefined
let me;
//=> undefined
```



## Data Structures

#### Arrays

arrays can contain any data type and start at index 0

```javascript
//arrays values of an array can be accessed through there inded value
let myArray = ["string", 100, true, null, undefined, myFunc]
myArray[0]
"string"
myArray[1]
 100
myArray[2]
 true
myArray[3]
 null
myArray[4]
 undefined
```



##### Objects

An object looks Like this `{}` or 

```javascript
class MyObject {

}
```

when we call any data type or data structure by its syntax its call a type literal otherwise it is an object

```
100 // number literal
"string" // string literal
true // boolean literal
{} // object literal
```
