- Why do you want to work at Codecademy?

  During my time at Flatiron I study for 30 hours a week for a 

- Tell us about a time knowledge wasn’t easily available to you and how you attained it. 

  Having been in tech industry for over a year now, I’ve countlessly ran into problems where I couldn’t find the answer any where. More specifically after graduating from flatirons boot camp I wanted to deploy my final project to Heroku which was not that difficult but, After having deployed it I had a problem with use cookies, evetime I’d refresh the browser the user would be logged out. This was strange because I never had this problem in development. I scoured GitHub, medium, YouTube, stack over-flow and I couldn’t quite find what I was looking for their was so much conflicting information. Finally after a week or so of endless google searches I accidently ran into a stack overflow post which then lead me to some API documentation and it was only after having tried to frankinstiening a bunch of stuff together did I find what I was looking for and, the best part was that all I had to do was set the prober domain name to my website inside my session store initializers. I literally got up out of my chair and started dancing because I was so happy that I’d found the answer. 

- Tell us about a time when you worked as a part of a team and how you solved any challenges that arose.

  Me and a good developer friend and I started a community organization on GitHub to help bring together boot camp grads, self-taught, and even formally educated software engineers to help build teamwork skills, job-skills through real deployed/in-development applications. One day one of our community members need help with an application which purpose was to find soccer games nearest to you. Turn out, our fellow member had a lot of really good questions even ones that none of us knew the answers too. Each of us took turns explain our understanding of the situation and how we visualize it and how it works. We all had our strong skills that we knew and we help eachother fill in the gaps for whatever the other may not quite understand helping us all build a better and more robust understanding of development and software.
