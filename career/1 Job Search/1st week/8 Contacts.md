Hello, 
My name is Cameron Leverett; I recently graduated from an online Software engineering boot camp (Flatiron).
Every week, I'm required to contact eight people per week and try to reach out and learn more about software development. I've recently been looking into Shopify. It seems like a great place to work. So I wanted to reach out to some people who work for that company. Anyway, I wondered, if not too much to ask and you have that time, what advice you might have given yourself when you first started looking for work.

I wanted to be transparent about my intentions, and I'm not looking to beg for a job or ask for any favors. I don't want anyone to feel. Uncomfortable with me contacting them.

With that said, I'd like to give you a little insight into who I am. I love everything computers, and I want to know as much as possible; I decided to become a web developer because I wanted a career that felt like I was building upon something to be apart of a community and a team. My dream is to go back to college and get a degree in electrical engineering because I want to understand computers and software deeply, not just learn how to memorize procedures. I've got a long way to go, and I don't mind that one (bit) because I love the journey, and the pursuit is what makes this worthwhile for me. The take away here is I want you and everyone to know how much I genuinely love computers and software..
