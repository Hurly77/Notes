Hi Melanie,



I'm Cameron J. Leveret; I attended the (Affirm Lunch & Learn). I just wanted to say how excited I was to hear about the company. I wanted to tell you a little anecdote about myself.



I Once worked for a tile setter. After a couple of weeks, he left me with the task of laying some tile for him. Long story short, I messed up big time. When I told him I'd "completely messed up," he said to me, "anyone can celebrate victory, but capacity is measured by failure."



At the time, I had no idea what he meant, but now I understand what he was saying. He was telling me that failure is an illusion, a misguided observation of progress.



Nobody is Immediately good at anything, we all make mistakes, and failing is simply part of the process. It is important to have the capacity to fail because some tasks, skills, jobs, and goals will take more failure than others.



I know at affirm you value
