**Does anyone have some insight on how to master tech/soft interview for web developers**

> Tech interviews are basically quizzes. Either increase your broader knowledge, or work on changing the game. For example, offer to walk an interviewer through your code. Practice ahead if you do this so you can make the journey enjoyable and in some logical order. Be ready to explain why and how decisions were made. For soft, do not ever try to lie and be in the moment. Remove distractions and avoid interrupting. When answering, use a few words of theirs in your answerer, if they ask, 'what size teams have you worked on?' instead of just giving a number, start with something like, 'Some of the team sizes I worked on were ...'People like hearing a few of their own words back if it is natural. It will also help them to immediately recognize that you are answering and following. Sometimes with calls, there can be drops or lag which makes it more obvious if you misheard them

> If you are interviewing online, make sure you have a good connection, working mic, and some good light. To check if the light is good, open an app which shows the webcam, and just move the laptop around until your face looks reasonably natural and well lit. Usually, the best spot is in front of the window during the day.
> Make sure their image on your screen is close to the camera so it looks more like you're looking at their eyes

> Not every interview will, nor should end up with a job offer. Don't let this fact get you down.
>
> Always ask for feedback of how you could have been a stronger candidate. I almost never get this request, but it is likely if I did, I'd probably spend an hour or so crafting a message meant to help the candidate. Some companies will be too afraid to provide a response, but it would be worth your effort to ask.

**what size teams have you worked on**

> 'So far, I've yet to work on a team. Part of why I'm asking to interview at your company is I'm hoping to change from working solo to working on a small team ...'

**So what makes someone stand out?**

> For your list, I would say I'd put it more like this:
>
> - Evidence the person can (or can learn to) take ownership of problems until the value is delivered. By this I mean if I ask you to fix a bug, I don't want to have to test it for you, go research the person who reported it, then chase you down if the fix gets deployed, but the person who reported it is ultimately unsatisfied. Team members should ideally learn to take these ownership elements and internalize them.
> - Evidence the person has studied a lot. For coworkers and interns a-like, it's hard to quickly say yes to someone who only has evidence of doing what was asked of them. I want to see people who do more. If everyone in class is reading 1 book, I'd like to talk to the person who is reading doing much more. When I was 12, I was reading about 100 pages a day.
> - Humility & receptiveness to feedback IMO go hand in hand
> - Have done things related to the field that they are excited about and can talk in extreme detail about if prompted.
> - If you read Elon Musk's interviewing strategies, it's somewhat similar to this. He says he looks for evidence of exceptional ability.

So, a few things.
Your menu at the top is neat and tidy, but I almost missed it, since my screen is large. You can leave it as-is, but I'd put some redundant links at the bottom if they're going to be this subtle on a large monitor.

Also, make it clear what you want. If I'm trying to find developers, I want you to make it dirt clear you're on the market, what you are looking for, so it's a lot easier for me to tell if I should spend more time reading.

I'm sure it's fun to do it in diary form, but it's not helping you make sales of your services.

Projects higher than tech. tbh, most business folks don't care about the tech you used if you never did any good projects with them.

Notice how you repeat the name of the project in both the title and the description. Cut to the chase. Why am I supposed to click on it?

Then, I clicked on `demo` Now you make me login. Now I'm kind of annoyed.

When I click demo, I expect to quickly understand the value. To me, that's what demo means.

> Initial commit with rails scaffold for a new api project. Setup project name, author, company and not much else.

> Added <xyz feature> for <abc use case>.

I also typically call out all changed systems in the same commit if there are multiple. If possible to make them smaller, I try to make them smaller.

Other than this, I'd also add some test cases. There are businesses that don't use test automation, but I don't expect them to be good places to work.
