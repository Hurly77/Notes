> Hi, I attended the (Affirm Lunch & Learn) and wanted to extend my gratitude. I was very excited to learn about Affirms Upward program and I’m eager to learn more about the company and will be applying to the Apprenticeship. Your talk about “accountability” help reinforce my own belief in accountably.
