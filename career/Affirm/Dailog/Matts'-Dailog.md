# Matt (Qualifications Team)

What skills should a candidate demonstrate during the technical interview

Typically What we look for is

- The ability to ask the right questions, why?, How do we solve this problem?
  - EX: what kind of function do we what to build? what kind of problem do we want to solve?

Hacker-Rank assessment 

- Code that works, code that compiles, code that runs?
- Code that is clean and concise. 
- are that functions well incapsulated? are they modular? is it easy to read?
- If you showed you code to your friends could they understand it and comment on it reasonably well?
- **Again** asking the right questions. what is the problem we are trying to solve? what is the best way we can solve that?
- Communicate your thought process. very important in this role.
