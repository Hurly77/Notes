## One of the most important tasks of a software engineer is continuous  learning. Technology is constantly evolving and the languages and tools  you use today may be replaced multiple times during your career. Explain how your pathway to becoming a software engineer shows your commitment  to continuous learning. You can consider the following questions to  structure your answer:

## **How have you practiced continuous learning? What qualities or habits  have helped you the most to continue learning? What challenges do you  face when it comes to continuous learning? How have you addressed these  challenges?**

## 1.) How have you practice continuous learning?

- practice paying it forward and help other to solve problems I've also struggled with.
- Practice writing technical blogs on medium.
- practice extensive note taking
- avid Reader of medium articles & feeds and repos.
- practice staying involved in the community on slack spaces stack-overflow, discord servers and read about how technology.
- teach other and help out where I can.
- Practice critical thinking to solve problems myself before looking it up. (allows me to retain info better)

## 2.) What qualities or habits have helped you the most to continue learning?

- I have a habit of needing to know how something works.
- habit of rabbit holing into new tech and languages. 
- habit of exposing my mind to code everyday.
- Listen and ask question about things I don't understand.
- my own personal philosophies.

## 3.) what challenges do you face when it comes to continuous learning?

1. Fear of rejection.
2. Getting carried with research.
3. Changing demand in what is need now.
4. Caveats in documentation as they pertain to my situation.

## 4.) How have you addressed these challenges

1. Meditation, cognitive behavioral analysis. 
2. Task scheduling and management.
3. Picking a few Specialties in industry standard that don't change very often.
4. Making a mission to ensure I've read the documentations on possible caveats.

**Timeline**

1. studied at Flatiron.
2. graduated.
3. Studied, developed and wrote about techology.
4. Teach a beach Coders.

**Thesis**

I've always been fascinated by computers, but I never had an outlet to explore that fascination as a kid. It wouldn't be until I was twenty-three that I'd purchase my first computer. Not long after, I built one of my own. Then in November of twenty-nineteen, I applied to Flatiron Schools' Software Engineering boot camp. It was at Flatiron that I learned valuable practices necessary for continuous learning. Practices included:

- Daily challenges.
- Peer-to-peer workshops.
- Code reviews.
- Writing weekly blogs about what I learned and why.

Though attending a full-time software engineering program was helpful, it wasn't until after I graduated that I'd genuinely demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning, indoctrinate my own practices, forge unique habits for staying with the curve, and combat the struggles it entails.

There have been two major methods I practice that help me stay intune with the ever changing technology. The first of which is contributing to a community, such as a discord servers for popular technology, reaching out to people about to collaborate on projects and exchange information
