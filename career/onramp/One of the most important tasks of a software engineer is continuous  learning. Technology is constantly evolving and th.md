## One of the most important tasks of a software engineer is continuous  learning. Technology is constantly evolving and the languages and tools  you use today may be replaced multiple times during your career. Explain how your pathway to becoming a software engineer shows your commitment  to continuous learning. You can consider the following questions to  structure your answer:

## **How have you practiced continuous learning? What qualities or habits  have helped you the most to continue learning? What challenges do you  face when it comes to continuous learning? How have you addressed these  challenges?**

- compassion and a capacity to empathize with people who have no different paths and life experiences.
- I want to be apart of something revolutionary.
- Silly, nervous, insecurity.

- 



## 1.) How have you practice continuous learning?

- practice paying it forward and help other to solve problems I've also struggled with.
- Practice writing technical blogs on medium.
- practice extensive note taking
- avid Reader of medium articles & feeds and repos.
- practice staying involved in the community on slack spaces stack-overflow, discord servers and read about how technology.
- teach other and help out where I can.
- Practice critical thinking to solve problems myself before looking it up. (allows me to retain info better)

## 2.) What qualities or habits have helped you the most to continue learning?

- I have a habit of needing to know how something works.
- habit of rabbit holing into new tech and languages. 
- habit of exposing my mind to code everyday.
- Listen and ask question about things I don't understand.
- my own personal philosophies.

## 3.) what challenges do you face when it comes to continuous learning?

1. Fear of rejection.
2. Getting carried with research.
3. Changing demand in what is need now.
4. Caveats in documentation as they pertain to my situation.

## 4.) How have you addressed these challenges

1. Meditation, cognitive behavioral analysis. 
2. Task scheduling and management.
3. Picking a few Specialties in industry standard that don't change very often.
4. Making a mission to ensure I've read the documentations on possible caveats.

**Timeline**

**Thesis**

I've always been fascinated by computers, but I never had an outlet to explore that fascination as a kid. It wouldn't be until I was twenty-three that I'd purchase my first computer. Not long after, I built one of my own. Then in November of twenty-nineteen, I applied to Flatiron Schools' Software Engineering boot camp. It was at Flatiron that I learned valuable practices necessary for continuous learning. Practices included:

- Daily challenges.
- Peer-to-peer workshops.
- Code reviews.
- Writing weekly blogs about what I learned and why.

Though attending a full-time software engineering program was helpful, it wasn't until after I graduated that I'd genuinely demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning, indoctrinate my own practices, forge unique habits for staying with the curve, and combat the struggles it entails.

There have been two major methods I've practice since graduating that have genuinely help me stay with the curve. The first of which is contributing to a community, such as a discord servers for popular technology, attending meet ups, events and conferences or reaching out to people to collaborate on projects and exchange information. Secondly, I try to keep an open mind and always try to access a situation before looking for the answer or asking someone else. The process of critical thinking if vital to a continuous learning environment as it is the practice of taking in new information to solving a problem never faced. I have many strategies that helped an continue to help me learn, but these methods are best couple with good habits.

Note Taking, I love taking notes. I use to hate taking notes but now, and you can even view them on my git-hub, I have an entire library of what I have learned and done. I love talking notes because not only does it help you retain information better but it also helps you to inform others. I often will write my notes as if I were trying to explain them to someone else that way I can later go back and use my notes to write blogs and share that information with my fellow developers. Anther really good habit I've fallen into is exposing myself to technology, I tell my students at Beach-coders, "keep exposing you mind to code", even if you only where to watch a YouTube video or read medium article it helps to keep you mind fresh and stay with the "rythm of syntax" as I like to call it. However,I still continue to struggle sometimes with certain challenges.

One of the major challenges that I've faced as a software engineer is the fear of rejection. In the world of tech it sometimes be scary to ask questions or for help. However, it may sound silly I like to meditate it helps keep me focused and also helps with the anxieties that I may have when reaching out to people or asking for help. I like to think that failure or rejection, is just the process of learning, and if your learning your succeeding.

I hope that I've adequately given you some insight on how my path to software engineering demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning. before I sign off I'd like to add that I genuinely love learning, anyone who knows me would tell you that. Also, as a last note, I would like thank the person reading this for taking the time to get to know me and no matter the outcome I found this to be a very rewarding experience havening written this essay.
