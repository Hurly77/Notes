# Optimizing Images with NextJS

Thanks to NextJS we have Access to a very Awesome component call `Image` which allows us to optimize the images for our application, watch closely.

```jsx
//so we start with a regular image tag like so

//lets start by importing the image compenent from nextJS
import Image from 'next/Image'

const myImage = () => {
    
    return (
    	<div>
        	<img src={'https://my-image-loaction'} />
            {/*Then we simply do the same exact thing that we did with our image tag only with the nextJS image Compoentn*/}
           	<Image src={"location"} height={0} width={0} />
            {/*we must provide a default length and width*/}
            {/*Providing the length and width attributes is what allows us to optimize the images*/}
            {/*Chrome uses the webp type with will shink the file down to the size provided so that we don't load in the whole file its self*/}
        </div>
    )
}
```

This allows us to only pre-load the size of the image that we need on initial load which will cut down on the amount fetch requests.
