# `_document.js`

The ` _app.js` is the root file for our application where as `_document.js`, as the name suggests, is for our documents. Let me explain.

lets first build a `_document.js`

```jsx
import import Doucument, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  render () {
    return (
      <Html>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NExtScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

```

 Note:  the **`Head`** component is not the same as the head component from `next/head`. The **`Head`** component imported from `next/document` is only meant to be used in the `_document.js` file.

Understanding import from `next/document`

- **`head`** This is only for use in the `_document.js`
- **`html`** - we can refine things like Lang or make changes to the body like overlays.
- **`Main`**
- **`NExtScript`**
