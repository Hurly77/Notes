# SEO, with Head	

We can use the NextJS meta tag `head` for better search engine optimization. We can just import `Head` from next which can be added anywhere in the application		 

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head'

function HomePage(props) {
  return (
   	<div>
       <Head> {/*WE simply just add <Head to our component for whatever meta we might need.*/}
         <meta name="description" content="Search Engine Optimization Events Near me"/>            
       </Head>
    </div>
  )
}
//This will help for search optization
```

#### `Head`

The head tag allows us to define any kind of `HTML` tag that we'd normally add to the head of our html page including title and meta tags etc.
