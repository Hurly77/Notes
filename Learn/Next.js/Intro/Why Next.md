# Why, NEXTJS

NextJS is a react frame work built to help solve **common problems when in production**. Common problems with routing and importing.

#### Key Features

- Built in`SSR` for better `SEO`(**S**earch **E**ngine **O**ptimization)
  - The most import feature is the built in server side rendering(SSR). Depending on the application that your build search engine optimization can have a negative impact on your website, for example. If your design a stand alone ecommerce website for bicycles3. when users do a google search such as “Best budget cycles”, any information static data that lives on you website match that discerption won’t be picked up by the search engine because none of you html will be loaded.
- NextJS won’t make you sacrifice the benefits you get with react
  - You’ll get the added (SPA) bonus from Next, because it only renders the initial page, after that nextJS will blend a combo of SSR and CSR.
- We also get a router with next, will be able to use a very basic syntax while still being able to the react functionality.
