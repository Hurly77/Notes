# Data Fetching



## page pre-Rendering



When a client makes a request for lets say `/myRoute` NextJS will send back a page that has already been rendered by the server so that the client won’t have to wait for pending fetch requests to return a status code. In Standard `react` the initial page will look like

```html
<div id="root"></div>
```

where as with next js we get  `SSR` that looks like this

```html
<div id="_next">
	<h1>A Page Title</h1>
	<div>
		<h2>Some page content<h2>
	</div>
</div>
```

This is really good for `SEO`.

We use react for handling user events and  user-submitted data. NextJS doesn’t just sent back a prerendered page but also sends back all the JavaScript code that belongs to it. We call this `Hydrating` the page, this will allow `react` to take control of the page.

There are two main kinds of pre-Rendering data. There is **`Static Generation` **and**`SSR`**(Server-Side Rendering)
