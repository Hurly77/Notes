# Static Generation with `getStaticProps`



## `staticGeneration`

**Static Generate** means that we Pre-generate a page during build time. This way all HTML and data that makes up the content is already loaded in to the during the build time. By `build` I mean that during deployment of you app, during the build the app is pre-render. 

After you app has been deployed pages are prepared ahead of time and can be cached by the server/ **CDN**(content delivery network) serving the app. Now when a Client makes a request to the server the pages can be severed to the client will any incoming requests are being resolved

Only inside the pages folder  we can use : (Can be added to any page file under the page `dir`)

```js
// it must be written exactly like this.
export async function getStaticProps(context){...0}
```

NextJS will automatically pre-generated. But we want to tell NextJS which files we want to be pre-rendered we can do that like so:

```jsx
const HomePage = (props) => {
	return (
    	<div>
        	<li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </div>
    )
}
// we always want to return an object with a key props
// The cool thing about this function is that instead of rendering the component function first we'll execute the getStaticProps function get our data and then render that data into the HomPage component.
export const getStaticProps = async() => {
    return {props: {
        products: [id: 'p1', title: 'Product 1']
    }}
}

export default HomePage
```

NextJS first executes the `getStaticProps` and then renders the `HomePage()` component.
