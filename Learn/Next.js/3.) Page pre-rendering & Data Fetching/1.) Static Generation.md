# Static Generation with `getStaticProps`



## `staticGeneration`

**Static Generate** means that we Pre-generate a page during build time. This way all HTML and data that makes up the content is already loaded in to the during the build time. By `build` I mean that during deployment of you app, during the build the app is pre-render. 

After you app has been deployed pages are prepared ahead of time and can be cached by the server/ **CDN**(content delivery network) serving the app. Now when a Client makes a request to the server the pages can be severed to the client will any incoming requests are being resolved

Only inside the pages folder  we can use : (Can be added to any page file under the page `dir`)

```js
// it must be written exactly like this.
export async function getStaticProps(context){...0}
```

NextJS will automatically pre-generated. But we want to tell NextJS which files we want to be pre-rendered we can do that like so:

```jsx
const HomePage = (props) => {
	return (
    	<div>
        	<li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </div>
    )
}
// we always want to return an object with a key props
// The cool thing about this function is that instead of rendering the component function first we'll execute the getStaticProps function get our data and then render that data into the HomPage component.
export const getStaticProps = async() => {
    return {props: {
        products: [id: 'p1', title: 'Product 1']
    }}
}

export default HomePage
```

NextJS first executes the `getStaticProps` and then renders the `HomePage()` component.

`getStaticProps` not only allows us to write server side code but also allows us to import node modules such as `fs` node files system.

```js
//as long as we don't attempt to use this in the client side code Next will split this away from the client side render. so the client wont see this import.
import fs from 'fs'
...
export const getStaticProps = async() => {
//normally we would not be able to run the fs.readFile() method but with Next we can actually import this in here and use the same way we would in a node application.
    fs.readFileSync()

    return {props: {
        products: [id: 'p1', title: 'Product 1']
    }}
}
```

Other cool things we can do with NextJS.

```js
//we can actually import what ever node modules we want as long as we only use them in the getStaticProps method
import path from 'path';
...
export const getStaticProps = async() => {
    //proccess is a global object that can be accessed anywhere with in a node application. Because nextJS doesn't read getStaticProps as a client file we can use the process object. 
    
    //cwd = current working directory. and will actually view the current directory as the top level.
 const filePath = path.join(process.cwd())
    return {props: {
        products: [id: 'p1', title: 'Product 1']
    }}
}
```

> SIDE NOTE :  keep in mind that `JSON`, is a global object just on both browser side and with node.
