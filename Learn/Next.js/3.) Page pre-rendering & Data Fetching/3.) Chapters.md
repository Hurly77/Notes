# More on `getStaticProps` & Configuration Options

**Key Points** 

- What is the `getStaticProps(context)` context argument for?

## `Context` argument

As I’m sure you’ve assumed `context` is an object. We won’t go to deep into this right now just remember it gives us more information on the about our page and execution of the page. Also any `dynamic` path segments any `params` we would get them through the context object passed into `getStaticProps`.

## Other keys for `getStaticProps`

We also have two other keys that we can you with `getStaticProps` the first which is a Boolean value `:notFound` if set to “true” is will send a 404 error and render the 404.html page. Also the `redirect` key which as it sounds allows you to redirect the user.

### `notFound` key

```jsx
//inside getStaticProps
if (data.products.length === 0){
    return { notFound:true}
}
//this way if there is no return data from our fetch request we can return a 404.html page
```

### `redirect` key

So if we Have no data at all we can redirect our user to a different page.

```js
if (!data) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/no-data',
      },
    };
  }
```

# Working with Dynamic Parameters

In the event that we’d like to render a page for a specific key we can use `context` argument to destructor the the incoming object for the key that we want

For example if we want a page just for the description of a product we can do this.

## example:

```jsx
const ProductDetailPage = (props) => {
    //we destructur the incoming props for the loadedProduct key
   const { loadedProduct } = props;
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h1>{loadedProduct.title}</h1>
      <p>{loadedProduct.description}</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
};
// we can access the context object to grab the paramter key
export const getStaticProps = async (context) => {
  const { params } = context;//this won't be valid until we render for a second time.

  const productId = params.pid;

  const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'data', 'dummy-backed.json');
  const jsonData = await fs.readFile(filePath);
  const data = JSON.parse(jsonData);
    //remeber that getStaticProps will execute first so when we render the page we'll already have our props loaded so we can access the specified object.

  const product = data.products.find((product) => product.id === productId);

  return {
      //beacuse this code will execute befor the our front end code, we can pass in our product object to props.
    props: {
       loadedProduct: product
    },
  };
};

export default ProductDetailPage;
```

We Need to Go back into our index.js file to change our `<li></li>` tag into a clickable link so we can test if this works.

## Testing `context` argument

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link'
...
return (
    <ul>
      {products.map((product) => (
        <li key={product.id}>
          <Link href={`/${product.id}`}>{product.title}</Link>
       	</li>
     ))}
   </ul>
...
```

“Error: `getStaticPaths` is required for dynamic SSG pages and is missing for `/[pid]` this is normal we need to implement more to the code in order to get this working



# Introducing `getStaticPaths` for dynamic Pages 

Because our `pid` page is technically multiple pages we see an error with our `getStaticProps`,  When we add `getStaticProps` we pre-generate the page, with out concreate information about the objects that will need those will need dynamic pages.

## Pre-generated Paths `(Routes)`

Dynamic pages (`[id].js` etc) don’t just need data: we also need to know **which** values will be available.

This way multiple concreate [id] page instances (e.g. id = 1) are pre-generated.

# Using `getStaticPaths`

In order to get our dynamic pages to work with `getStaticProps` we’ll need `getStaticPaths` 

## example

The purpos of the `getStaticPaths` is to create multiple instances of our `pid` page

```jsx
export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
   return {
    paths: [
      {params: {pid: 'p1'}},
      {params: {pid: 'p2'}},
      {params: {pid: 'p3'}}
    ],
    fallback: false
  }
  //above were telling nextJs what paths must be pregenerated for our dynamic route segmants.
}
```
