# 10 ). More on `getStaticProps` & Configuration Options

**Key Points** 

- What is the `getStaticProps(context)` context argument for?

## `Context` argument

As I’m sure you’ve assumed `context` is an object. We won’t go to deep into this right now just remember it gives us more information on the about our page and execution of the page. Also any `dynamic` path segments any `params` we would get them through the context object passed into `getStaticProps`.

## Other keys for `getStaticProps`

We also have two other keys that we can you with `getStaticProps` the first which is a Boolean value `:notFound` if set to “true” is will send a 404 error and render the 404.html page. Also the `redirect` key which as it sounds allows you to redirect the user.

### `notFound` key

```jsx
//inside getStaticProps
if (data.products.length === 0){
    return { notFound:true}
}
//this way if there is no return data from our fetch request we can return a 404.html page
```

### `redirect` key

So if we Have no data at all we can redirect our user to a different page.

```js
if (!data) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/no-data',
      },
    };
  }
```

# 11.) Working with Dynamic Parameters

In the event that we’d like to render a page for a specific key we can use `context` argument to destructor the the incoming object for the key that we want

For example if we want a page just for the description of a product we can do this.

## example:

```jsx
const ProductDetailPage = (props) => {
    //we destructur the incoming props for the loadedProduct key
   const { loadedProduct } = props;
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h1>{loadedProduct.title}</h1>
      <p>{loadedProduct.description}</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
};
// we can access the context object to grab the paramter key
export const getStaticProps = async (context) => {
  const { params } = context;//this won't be valid until we render for a second time.

  const productId = params.pid;

  const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'data', 'dummy-backed.json');
  const jsonData = await fs.readFile(filePath);
  const data = JSON.parse(jsonData);
    //remeber that getStaticProps will execute first so when we render the page we'll already have our props loaded so we can access the specified object.

  const product = data.products.find((product) => product.id === productId);

  return {
      //beacuse this code will execute befor the our front end code, we can pass in our product object to props.
    props: {
       loadedProduct: product
    },
  };
};

export default ProductDetailPage;
```

We Need to Go back into our index.js file to change our `<li></li>` tag into a clickable link so we can test if this works.

## Testing `context` argument

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link'
...
return (
    <ul>
      {products.map((product) => (
        <li key={product.id}>
          <Link href={`/${product.id}`}>{product.title}</Link>
       	</li>
     ))}
   </ul>
...
```

“Error: `getStaticPaths` is required for dynamic SSG pages and is missing for `/[pid]` this is normal we need to implement more to the code in order to get this working



# 12.) Introducing `getStaticPaths` for dynamic Pages 

Because our `pid` page is technically multiple pages we see an error with our `getStaticProps`,  When we add `getStaticProps` we pre-generate the page, with out concreate information about the objects that will need those will need dynamic pages.

## Pre-generated Paths `(Routes)`

Dynamic pages (`[id].js` etc) don’t just need data: we also need to know **which** values will be available.

This way multiple concreate [id] page instances (e.g. id = 1) are pre-generated.

# 13.) Using *getStatic**Paths***   

In order to get our dynamic pages to work with `getStaticProps` we’ll need `getStaticPaths` 

## example

The purpose of the `getStaticPaths` is to create multiple instances of our `pid` page

```jsx
export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
   return {
    paths: [
      {params: {pid: 'p1'}},
      {params: {pid: 'p2'}},
      {params: {pid: 'p3'}}
    ],
    fallback: false
       //we will revist what this means.
  }
  //above were telling nextJs what paths must be pregenerated for our dynamic route segmants.
}
```



# 14.) “getStatic**Paths**”

if we use `npm run build` we can create a pre-optimized build we’ll see that our dynamic paths are now added as pages. in our pre-optimized build.

![image-20210410161459139](C:\Users\camer\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210410161459139.png)

Then we can run `npm start` and we navigate to `‘/’` route and reload the page. In the dev console under network/response we can see the even before we click the link we have prefetched the data.

```json
{"pageProps":{"loadedProduct":{"id":"p1","title":"Product 1","description":"This is product 1"}},"__N_SSG":true}
```



# 15.) Working with Fallback Pages

if we are working with multiple pages, say upward of a hundred we don’t want to set param for each one of those pages as some pages will hardly ever be visited while others are visited frequently.

That is were the `fallback` comes in handy, if we set the fallback key to true and get rid of the p2, and p3

```js
  return {
    paths: [
      {params: {pid: 'p1'}},
      //{params: {pid: 'p2'}},
      //{params: {pid: 'p3'}}
    ],
    //fallback: false
     	fallback: true
  }
```

The above will allow us to navigate to other pages dynamically with out having to specify params.

But if we navigate to p2 or p3 we via the manually typing in the URL, we receive and error telling us that our props are undefined.

To remedy this we can simply introduce the following 

```jsx
const ProductDetailPage = (props) => {
  const {loadedProduct} = props
  //simply check if the props is availble yet
  if(!props){
     return <h1>Loading...</h1>
     }
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h1>{loadedProduct.title}</h1>
      <p>{loadedProduct.description}</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
};
```



# 16.) Loading Paths Dynamically

We don’t want to hard code our params into the return value

Instead of hard coding all the params we can simply do this

```jsx
 return {
    paths: [
      {params: {pid: 'p1'}},
      {params: {pid: 'p2'}},
      {params: {pid: 'p3'}}
    ],
    fallback: false
  }
//change the about to do this

export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  const data = await getData();
  const ids = data.products.map((product) => product.id);
  const params = ids.map((id) => ({params: {
    pid: id
  }}));

  return {
    paths: params,
    fallback: false,
  };
};
```



# 17.) Fallback & “notFound” pages

When we have dynamic routes we want insure that in the event that the data does not exist we have a page to render to the client such as a 404.html page we can do that like this.

```jsx
export const getStaticProps = async context => {
  const { params } = context;
  const productId = params.pid;
  const data = await getData();

  const product = data.products.find(product => product.id === productId);
	//here we simply set the notFound key to true if the product was not found.
  if(!products){
    return {notFound: true}
  }

  return {
    props: {
      loadedProduct: product,
    },
  };
};
```
