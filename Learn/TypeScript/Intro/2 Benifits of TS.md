# TypeScript Overview

With **TypeScript** We get all the same feature that we do with JavaScript plus added features such as:

- Types! `cosnt myFunction = **(num: number, name: string)** => {}`
- Net-gen JavaScript Features (compiled down for older Browsers)
- Non-JavaScript Features like interfaces or Generics
- Meta-Programming features like decorators
- Rich Configuration options
- Modern tooling that helps even in non-TypeScript Projects
