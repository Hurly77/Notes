# Object Types in TypeScript

**"bare-word"** - as in contrast to a "keyword", such as `let`, `const`, `function`, etc.. a bare word is any non-string/integer that is no reserved by JavaScript. ("I call these bare words not sure if there is actually term for what I'm referring to")

In JavaScript the way to define an Object is to simply set a bare-word or variable, like so :

```javascript
const person = {
	name: "Cameron",
	age: "26"
};

console.log(person);
```

If we ran this file we'd simply see the our object `person` has been logged to the console as expected but, lets say we were to do something like this:

```js
console.log(person.height)
```

 and suppose we were to run `tsc ` on the file containing the above code. We Receive. This would cause and error during compilation telling us that there is no `height` property for our `person` object.

If your using VSCode and your using something like intelicence if you have over  where we declared  the `person` object you'll see some thing that looks like this

```typescript
const person: {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}
```

As you can see it looks like an object but it is instead inferring that `person` is an object that as a `name` property that should be a string and an `age` property that should be a number. Also instead of commas  we have semicolons that is because this is not JavaScript syntax this is the inference in which typescript is exception our declaration to follow or mimic.
