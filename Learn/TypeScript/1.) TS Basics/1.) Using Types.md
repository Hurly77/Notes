# Using Types with TypeScript

**Core Types**

- **Number** - `1, 5.3 - 10` `all numbers, no differentiation between integers or floats`.
- **String**  - `'Hi', "Hi"`, and ```hi` ``.
- **Boolean** - `true, false` a truthy value or falsy value.
- **Object** - `{age: 30}` Any JavaScript object, more specific types (type of object) are possible.

**Numbers** here is an example of how we could use JavaScript to Type Check instead of using "TypeScript"

```js
function add(n1 , n2) {
    //in plain vanilla JS we Could go ahead and validate input like so.
    if(typeof n1 !== 'number' && typeof n2 !== 'number'){
        throw new Error("Incorrect Input!");
    }
	return n1 + n2;
}
```



Though If we use TypeScript we can "**Type Check**" before Runtime and during development

Note: **That TypeScript is a Development only Language we do not use TypeScript during development**

However There will be some cases in which we will not be able to avoid validation at runtime and that is okay because with TypeScript we really just want to minimize the about of bugs/errors that our application has.

Our Example for type checking with TypeScript is to do the following to our code 

```typescript
function add(n1: number, n2: number) {
    //notice above we set a static parameter.
	return n1 + n2;
}

const number1 = '5';
const number2 = 2.8;

let res = add(number1, number2);
console.log(res);

```

In our `add` function we set static parameters to check each argument make sure that they are both numbers when we run `tsc our-filename.ts` we will receive and error that would look something like this.

```bash
Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

let res = add(number1, number2);
```

Now again this is a development only 

When defining a variable we can actually infer what **Type** the variable should be Ex:

```Typescript
let userName: string;
userName = "Hurly77"
//but if we were to try and set it equal to a number like so
userName = 100
//the text editor would throw a type error
```

another way we could infer a variable is like so
WARNING DO NOT DO IT LIKE THIS;

```typescript
const userName: string = 'Hurly77'
```

we can accomplish this however it would be pointless as we do not rely on type inference. **TypeScript was created** for the purpose of detecting errors early on and avoiding some runtime errors.

**CONCLUSION** 
The main difference between JavaScript and TypeScript is the ***TS types are checked during compilation*** where as with ***JS, Types are checked during runtime***.
