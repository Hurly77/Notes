# Blockchain Big picture

There are accentually two parts to a block chain this consists of 

1. The Chain
   - A List
2. The Data
   - A Number
   - A String
   - A Boolean
   - Complex structure like dictionaries and arrays

## Going over Data Types

### **Numbers**

In Python there are to forms of numbers as integers that includes plain **"Integers"** and **"Floats."**

In Python the **size of a variable** is completely determined by your OS and hardware unlike in node or JavaScript where to big of a number will give you `infinity` back.

### `Booleans`

Booleans include **`true`** or **`false`** data
**If we run the `int()` method**

```python
int(True)
#=> 1
int(False)
#=> 0
#or with Float
float(True)
#=> 1.0
float(False)
#=> 0.0
```

Another really cool function of python is that snake case or **`snake_case_numbers`** are valid integers in python

```python
100_0_0
#=> 10000
```

With operators we have all the basic math operators like `+ - / * ** =` and so on. However if we use the **`/`** operator we get a float

```python
10/2
#=> 5.0
#alternative would be //
10//2
#=> 5
#any result less than 1 will return 0
2//10 
#=> 0
```

### `Strings`

we can mix `+` with two string; python will concatenate the two strings like so.

```python
'hello' + 'world'
#=> 'helloworld'
```

Strings are just text. which can contain numbers but are actually stings.

​	We can also define text over multiple lines in the **REPL** by doing three `"""` quotation marks like so

```python
>>> long_txt = """ a lot of text can go here
and we can hit enter to drop the line 
keep in mind that will get a \n in or return"""
>>> long_txt
#=> ' a lot of text can go here\nand we can hit enter to drop the line \nkeep in mind that will get a \n in or return'
```

we can also use the triple quote syntax in python code like so

```python
#if I define a function like so
def my_func():
	""" This is my Function """
	print("hello world")
```

​	now the `"""` will show up in the description of the function in your IDE such as Visual Studio Code which is what I use.

### `Lists`

List are much like arrays in JavaScript

```python
>>> blockchain = [1, 2.2, 3]
>>> blockchain
#=> [1, 2.2, 3]
```

some methods we can use are 

**`pop(idx:any)`** will remove the last element in a list

**`append(idx:any)`** will add an element to the end of the list
