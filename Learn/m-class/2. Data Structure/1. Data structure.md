# What is a data Structure

We can think of data structures like common house hold containers such as backpack, drawer, fridge, box, file.

For Example you wouldnâ€™t put a yogurt inside of  a file or a drawer that would not work. 

We can store scalar values. Objects, arrays are data structures but data types are integers, strings, Booleans, null etc..
