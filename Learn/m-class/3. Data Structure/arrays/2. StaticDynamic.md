# Static Arrays vs. Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic Array - growable array, resizable array, dynamic table, mutable array, or array list is a random access, variable-zise list data structre that allows elements to be added or removed.  are those **arrays** which are allocated memory at the run time with the help of heap.Thus **Dynamic array** can change its size during run time. **Example**- `int*temp=new int[100]; thumb_up | 0. thumb_down |`

Static Array - have their size or length determined when the array is created and/or allocated. For this reason, they may also be reffered to as fixed-length arrays or fixer arrays. **Array** values may be specified when the array is defined, or the array size may be defined without specifying array content.

## Static

IN C++ static arrays look like this

```c++
int a[20]
```

or

```c++
int b[5]  {1,2,3,4,5}
```

In JavaScript we mainly work with Dynamic arrays. Or at least they act like Dynamic arrays. In JavaScript the allocation process is auto matric.  

## Dynamic

With Dynamic arrays when using something like the `assign` method, we loop over the array and then copy the array and move it to another place in memory to adjust dynamically to create more space. That is why it can be more efficient to use static arrays.
