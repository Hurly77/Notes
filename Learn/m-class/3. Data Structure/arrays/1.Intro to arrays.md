# Data structure operations

- **Insertion** - An insertion sort  compares values in turn, starting with the second value in the list. If theis value is greater than the value to the left of it, no changes are made. otherwise this value is repeatedly moved left until it meets a value the is less than It. This continues until the den of the list is reached.
- **deletion** - deletion refers to removing an existing element from the array and re-organizing all elements of an array.
- **traversal** - when ever you ‘travel’ across an array the is considered traversing like with `for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++)`
- **searching** - when ever you traverse and array for a given value this is called traversal. 
- **sorting** - When you use insertion and and deletion while traversing an array, for example when you replace and element in an array your also deleting the current on or “over writing”. then recreating a new element.
- **Access** This is when you want a reticular element from a given array with a particular number ‘n’ which would represent the index of the rack in the ram.



```js
//Ram shelf
let i = "Ram address" 
let bits = "binary code"
let shelf = [[i][bits*8]]
const RamRack ={
[[i][bits*8]] 
[[i][bits*8]]
[[i][bits*8]]
[[i][bits*8]]
[[i][bits*8]]
[[i][bits*8]]
[[i][bits*8]]
}
//usually with a 64X computer a number will take about 8 ram racks to store just one element.
```

Lets look at the table view of this

| Address | Array Element |
| ------- | ------------- |
| 0       | apple         |
| 1       | Bana          |
| 2       | egg           |
| 3       | bread         |
| 4       | etc…          |
|         |               |
|         |               |
|         |               |

## Diving deeper

```js
const string = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
//4*4 16 bytes of storage

//push- our computer already know where how big the array all we have to do is add an addtional element at the end of that array. so we get O(1), because the time complexity is linear
strings.push; //0(1)

//pop - this can also be applied to pop()
strings.pop();
strings.pop()//O(1)


// unshift- however require changing the index of every element it the array so
unshift.string()//O(n)

//splice - also require moving each element, the fall between 2-0 
strings.splice(2, 0, 'alien');//O(n)
```
