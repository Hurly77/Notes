| CPU        | RAM       | Drive     |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| var a  = 1 | var a = 1 | var a = 1 |
|            |           |           |

Ram has a shelf of information with `address` each shell holds 8 bits. A bit is a switch represented as 1 or 0. The CPU has a memory controller which allows the CPU to read each shelf.

 The closer the shelf is the faster the access time is. shelf 1 shelf 2 can be grabbed faster shelf 1 and shelf 1000.

An integer for example are stored in 32 bits of block memory. or now 64 bits of block memory. so 4 or 8 shelf.
