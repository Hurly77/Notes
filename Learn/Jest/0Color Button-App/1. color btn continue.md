# Color button continued	

##### Definitions

- Assertions - indicates that will be working with RegEx, and should include both a begin and end of lines and words, and other patterns indicating in some way that a match is possible (including look-ahead, look-behind, and conditional expressions) EX: 

  - ```js
    const regexpLastWord = /\w+$/;
    console.log(text.match(regexpLastWord));
    // expected output: Array ["fox"]
    ```

## `fireEvent`

Our next jest will test an event. To get started will have to import another object from `@testing-library/react`.

```jsx
test('button has correct initial color', () => {
  render(<App />);
  // find an element with a role of button and text of 'Change to blue'
  const colorButton = screen.getByRole('button', {name: 'Change to blue'})
  expect(colorButton).toHaveStyle({backgroundColor: 'red'})
});
test('button turns blue when clicked', () => {
  render(<App />) 
  
})
```

The implementation of this is quite simple, as good practice will put this in the same assertion that tests our button color and text.

```js
...
fireEvent.click(colorButton);
```
