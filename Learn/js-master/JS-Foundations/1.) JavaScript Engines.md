## JavaScript Engines

- (**AST**) or “**A**bstract **S**yntax **T**ree” — is a way of representing the **syntax** of a programming language as a hierarchical **tree**-like structure
- **profiling** (“program profiling,” “software profiling”) is a form of a dynamic program that measures, for example, the space (memory) or time complexity for a program, the instructions or the frequency and duration of function calls
- A **compiler** is a unique program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or “code” that a computer’s processor uses.
- **Lexical** — closely matching the meaning of the term in common usage. As its other name implies, this is the sort of definition one is likely to find in the dictionary.

To those who don’t know what the v8 Engine is, it is essentially the engine that interprets JavaScript or compiles it. It’s important to note that the v8 engine is not the only engine out there. The V8 Engine is just the one that Google and NodeJS happen to use. To see more about what browsers use which engine, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine#:~:text=A JavaScript engine is a,executes JavaScript (JS) code.&text=JavaScript engines are typically developed,via the Document Object Model.).

*There Five basic steps of the V8 Engine*.

1. **Parser**
2. **AST**
3. **Interpreter**
4. **Profiler**
5. **Compiler**

When we run a JavaScript file, the code is broken down into tokens; you’ve probably heard the terms ***lexical analysis\***, **lexing, or Tokenizer**. Lexical analysis is just the process of breaking down code into tokens based on the meaning of the keyword or what the code is trying to do. These “**tokens**,” as we call them, are then formed into an **AST**, and there is a fun tool that allows you to view the [AST](https://astexplorer.net/) if you’d like to check it out.

Once the AST has finished, the code will be pushed to the interpreter and thrown into a compiler or profiler. However, the V8 Engine uses **JIT** (Just-In-Time) compiler. The JIT-compiler actually isn’t a compiler at all or an interpreter. It can be thought of more like a hybrid between the both. The JIT compiler allows us to execute code at run time instead of executing it before the code runs. With JIT, we get heavy optimization that enables the compiler and profiler to optimize the byte code better to work more efficiently. It's important to note that *Byte code* is not *Machine code*. Byte code needs to operate through v8 Engine to execute it directly by the virtual machine or a JS engine.

A common misconception is that JavaScript is an interpreted language. You have probably heard something like, “JavaScript is an interpreted language,” but this isn’t always the case. You could create an implementation of JavaScript using the JS Engine that only compiles if you wanted to. I’m not saying that it would have any optimized impact; it's just a fun fact. What it can do is help you understand JavaScript on a deeper level.

### web Assembly

Before we dive into more about memory in JavaScript lets first look at a major game changing Format called Web Assembly.

> **Web Assembly** - standard portable binary-code format for executable programs. As well as interface for interaction between program environments.
>
> Thanks to web assembly we now have a standard that all the browsers can agree up which allows for better optimized code.

### Stack and Heap

The call stack and Heap won’t interfere with you day-to-day work flow. However it is really import to understand these problems as they are foundational concepts that every JavaScript engineer should understand.

#### what is the Call Stack?

The call stack is **responsible for keeping the flow of execution** for our application. Without it JavaScript wouldn’t know what to call or when. 

Lets review an example of how we can communicate to the call stack.

```js
//lets make a function the returns Hello would 
const add = (a, b) => {
    if(a && b){
        return a + b
    }
   return 'No Numbers'
}
const subtract = (a, b) => {
    if(a, b){
        return a - b
    }
   return 'No Numbers '
}

const addAndSubtract = (a, b) => {
   let num1 = add(a, b)//=> 1500
   let num2 = subtract(a, b)//=> -500
   return num1 + num2 /// 1500 + (-500) = 1000
}

addAndSubtract(500, 1000)
//=> 1000

//so the call stack would look like this.
|addAndSubtract|
//addAndSubtract is placed on the stack, then if we step inside this function the stack will look like this:
|add           | 
|addAndsubtract|
//after execution, it will go to the next line of code and execute subtract.
|subtract      | 
|addAndsubtract|
// once there is no code left inside the function we return a number and the function is poped of the stack.
|addAndSubtract|
// not paused
  
//=> The first function that gets call is addAndSubtract function, we then set inside the function scope and we get two new functions added to the stack.

```

#### what is the memory Heap?

The Heap is responsible for storing our data. This is were the **memory allocation** happens. 

lets review that following

```js
//if we declare a variable
const myString = "My sting says Hello"// Here we are telling the browser "allocate memory for a string"
const num = 1000 //again were telling the heap to allocate memory for this variable that is an integer
// lets switch things up a bit, if  i open an object literal like so:
const Cameron = {
   firstName: 'cameron',
   lastName: 'Leverett',
}
// This mean I want to allocate memory for an object and have it point the the follwoing keys wich point the the following values.
```

Since all the JavaScript engines are all different, were variable are allocated isn’t always the same all the time. For the most part you can think of it like this, more simple variables will be stored in the stack and more complex variables such as Objects, Arrays and more complex data structures.
