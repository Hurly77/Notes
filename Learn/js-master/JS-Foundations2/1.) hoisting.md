# What is Hoisting and Execution Context in JavaScript?

Hoisting is the conceptual understanding of the execution context and the “creation” and “execution” phases. However I can be confusing because as the name suggests Hoisting, doesn’t actually move you code anywhere. The common understanding of hoisting is that variables and functions are moved to the top of you code but this is not true. The code that you write will stay and be read exactly where you wrote it. To make things a little more easy to understand lemme give you a brief recap on JavaScript runtime environment. 

## Intro to JavaScript Runtime.

To make things simple I’m going to skip over a lot of information and get straight into the thick of it. So first things first when you write a JavaScript program say one that looks like this.

```js
let myName = "Cameron"

const getName = (name) => {
    return name
}

getName(myName)
// keep in mind that none of the above code is hoisted, arrow functions are not hoisted.
```

lets go through the sets 

1. **Global execution context** - This is called `main()`, and is needed to run any of your code
2. **Context Stack** - you can think of this as a  queue or an sequence of tasks.
3. **execution context -** The execution context is what will be ran when another “task” is place on the Context stack, and is what is held in the body of the above code.
4. **creation phase -** This is the phase in which you code is read and prepared for execution.
5. **execution phase -** Finally we come to the execution, once all the above has occurred your code will then be executed.

So this is the order for the above code

```js
//js creats global exection main()
main() //we then step into the body of main()

//ps this is not how this actually occurs physically just a visual representation
main(){
    //create execution context for main()
    //since none of the above code is hoisted and no code creates new context will just run the code
    //run
    getName(name) // arg: "cameron"
    //=> "cameron"
}
//destroy execution context.
"cameron"
```

Now the you have guided to reference lets get into the weeds a bit more and demonstrate some actual hoisting.

Keep in mind that only “declarations” are hoisted not “initializers”. Also keep in mind that `const`, `let` don’t initialized until after the “creation phase” but `var` and `function` do. 

```js
var declaration; //delclaration
myVar = "initializer" // initializer
```

Now that we handle the basic understanding of execution context and JavaScript runtime lets go through so more complicated code

First I’ll create some static data for our method

```js
//key in mind that the first execution context  created is main() the JS global execution context enviroment.
// lets create a method for finding a video games about that will be release in 2021.
realsingSoon = [ 
  {
    title: 'Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart',
    price: 69.99,
    releases: 'June 11 2021',
  },
  {
    title: 'Bio Mutant',
    price: 59.99,
    releases: 'May 25 2021',
  },
  {
    title: 'prince of Persia: The sands of Time',
    price: 39.99,
    releases: '2021',
  },
];
```

Then we can write some code and evaluate it.

```js
bigFunc(realsingSoon);//hoisted

var realsingSoon;// hoisted during creation phase.

function bigFunc (arr) {// hoisted so we can call anywhere
  // here the entire function is

  const getAllTitles = (array) => {//arrow function is declared by not intialized til execution
    const titles = [];
    array.map((game) => {
      titles.push(game.title);
    });
    return titles;
  };

  let ordered = orderByPrice('down');//we can set a not hoisted var to hold a hoisted value, because our value is hoisted

  function orderByPrice (filter) {// hoisted
    if (filter === 'down') {
      return arr.sort(function (a, b) {// this  is know as Immediately Invokable Function Expression or IIFE for short
        b.price - a.price;
      });
    } else {
      return arr.sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price);
    }
  }

  let games = getAllTitles(ordered);
  

  return games;
}
```

Keep in mind that this is as you probably know not good code it is merely just for demonstration. 

After defining our data `realsingSoon` The first thing we defined was 

```js
bigFunc(releasing soon)

var realsingSoon;
...
```

So as we discussed before there are to main phases “creation” and “execution”. During the creation phase an execution context is created for all hoisted keywords such as `function` and `var`. That is why our `bigFunc` function is able to run above all other code even and why `realisingSoon` variable is able to be declared after the value has been set.

```js
...
const getAllTitles = (array) => {//not hoisted
    const titles = [];
    array.map((game) => {
      titles.push(game.title);
    });
    return titles;
  };
...
```

This is called an arrow function which is similar to function expression and  behaves exactly the same and is not hoisted nor does it have its own execution context so we can't call it before it is declared.

```js
...
let ordered = orderByPrice('down');//because the function key work is hoisted we can call it before declaration.

  function orderByPrice (filter) {// function key word is hoisted
    if (filter === 'down') {
      return arr.sort(function (a, b) {// this  is know as Immediately Invokable Function Expression or IIFE for short
        b.price - a.price;
      });
    } else {
      return arr.sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price);
    }
  }

  let games = getAllTitles(ordered);
  

  return games;
}
```

Above you'll notice that we called our `orderByPrice` function before be declared it that is because it is also hoisted. This means that during execution we delayered and initialized so that it can be called at any point with in the execution context.

More on execution context. When ever we declarer a new function whether that be with the `function` keyword or function expression we will get a new execution context or new scope. but we can get around that by simple using the `let` keyword to declare a variable outside the execution context like so

```js
let number; 
const funcExpress = () => {
	number = 0;
	return number;
}

funcExpress()
//=> 0
```

I hope this help clarify you understanding of execution context and hoisting. Please if you have anything to add or want more information leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer any question or make updates based on feedback.
