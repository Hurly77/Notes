# What is Hoisting in JavaScript?

Hoisting is the conceptual understanding of the execution context and the “creation” and “execution” phases. However I can be confusing because as the name suggests Hoisting, doesn’t actually move you code anywhere. The common understanding of hoisting is that variables and functions are moved to the top of you code but this is not true. The code that you write will stay and be read exactly where you wrote it. To make things a little more easy to understand lemme give you a brief recap on JavaScript runtime environment. 

## Intro to JavaScript Runtime.

To make things simple I’m going to skip over a lot of information and get straight into the thick of it. So first things first when you write a JavaScript program say one that looks like this.

```js
let myName = "Cameron"

const getName = (name) => {
    return name
}

getName(myName)
// keep in mind that none of the above code is hoisted, arrow functions are not hoisted.
```

lets go through the sets 

1. **Global execution context** - This is called `main()`, and is needed to run any of your code
2. **Context Stack** - you can think of this as a  queue or an sequence of tasks.
3. **execution context -** The execution context is what will be ran when another “task” is place on the Context stack, and is what is held in the body of the above code.
4. **creation phase -** This is the phase in which you code is read and prepared for execution.
5. **execution phase -** Finally we come to the execution, once all the above has occurred your code will then be executed.

So this is the order for the above code

```js
//js creats global exection main()
main() //we then step into the body of main()

//ps this is not how this actually occurs physically just a visual representation
main(){
    //create execution context for main()
    //since none of the above code is hoisted and no code creates new context will just run the code
    //run
    getName(name) // arg: "cameron"
    //=> "cameron"
}
//destroy execution context.
"cameron"
```

Now the you have guided to reference lets get into the weeds a bit more and demonstrate some actual hoisting.

Keep in mind that only “declarations” are hoisted not “initializers”. Also keep in mind that `const`, `let` don’t initialized until after the “creation phase” but `var` and `function` do. 

```js
var declaration; //delclaration
myVar = "initializer" // initializer
```

Now that we handle the basic understanding of execution context and JavaScript runtime lets go through so more complicated code

First I’ll create some static data for our method

```js
//key in mind that the first execution context  created is main() the JS global execution context enviroment.
// lets create a method for finding a video games about that will be release in 2021.
var realsingSoon = [
  {
    title: 'Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart',
    price: 69.99,
    releases: 'June 11 2021',
  },
  {
    title: 'Bio Mutant',
    price: 59.99,
    releases: 'May 25 2021',
  },
  {
    title: 'prince of Persia: The sands of Time',
    price: 39.99,
    releases: '2021',
  },
];
```

Then we can write some code and evaluate it.

```js
function bigFunc (arr) {// here the entire function is 
      
    const getAllTitles = (array) => {
      const titles = [];
      array.map((game) => {
        titles.push(game.title);
      });
      return titles;
    },
      
    function orderByPrice (filter) {
      if (filter === 'down') {
        return arr.sort((a, b) => b.price - a.price);
      } else {
        return arr.sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price);
      }
    },
    
  let ordered = orderByPrice('down');
  let games = getAllTitles(ordered);
  return games;
}

bigFunc(realsingSoon);
```
